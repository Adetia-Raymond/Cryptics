# Mobile .env.example
# Copy to `.env` or load with your preferred env loader for Expo/React Native.
# Backend base URL (use emulator-friendly address during development):
# - Android emulator (Android Studio): http://10.0.2.2:8000
# - Genymotion/other: use host machine IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8000)
# - iOS simulator: http://localhost:8000
# - Physical device: use your machine's LAN IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8000)

# Base API URL used by the mobile client
# Default to localhost for development when running backend locally
# - If using iOS simulator or Expo in VS Code on the same machine, `http://localhost:8000` is fine
# - If using Android emulator that cannot reach host `localhost`, use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`

# Mobile refresh strategy hint (informational):
# - "cookie" = rely on httpOnly cookie (NOT supported for native clients)
# - "token_in_body" = send refresh token in body to /auth/refresh (requires backend support)
# - "secure_storage" = mobile stores refresh token securely and uses it with mobile refresh endpoint
MOBILE_REFRESH_STRATEGY=secure_storage

# Toggle verbose debug logging for mobile-only diagnostics (optional)
